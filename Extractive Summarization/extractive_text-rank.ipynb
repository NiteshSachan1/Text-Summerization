TextRank is an unsupervised extractive summarization technique based on graph-based ranking algorithms. 
It is a general-purpose algorithm that can be applied to a variety of tasks, including keyword extraction and sentence extraction. 
The algorithm constructs a graph from the text, where sentences are nodes and edges between them represent sentence similarity. 
The similarity between sentences is determined by their content overlap, usually measured by cosine similarity. 
Once the graph is constructed, the algorithm uses a variant of the PageRank algorithm to rank the sentences. 
The top-ranked sentences are then extracted to form the summary. TextRank is simple, efficient, and language-independent, 
making it a popular choice for extractive summarization.
